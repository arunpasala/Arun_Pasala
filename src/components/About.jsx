        <p>I’m a proactive full-stack developer passionate about building intelligent and dynamic web experiences. 
            From crafting sleek user interfaces with React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS to developing robust backends with Node.js and 
            Python, 
            I love turning ideas into impactful digital solutions.
        <br />
Currently pursuing my Master’s in Computer Science, I’m expanding my expertise into AI-powered web applications — blending creativity, 
performance, and smart automation.

Beyond coding, I’m driven by curiosity — constantly exploring new technologies, improving design interactions with Three.js and GSAP, and 
learning how AI can redefine user experience.
<br />
I believe in waking up every day ready to create, learn, and make a difference. 🌱</p>
